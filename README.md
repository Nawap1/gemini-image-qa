# Photo Q&A
Gemini Photo Q&A is a web application that allows users to upload images and interact with them through a question and answer interface. Users can ask questions about the content of the images and receive relevant information or insights based on the image analysis. It uses the Gemini 2.0 Flash API to achieve this functionality.
